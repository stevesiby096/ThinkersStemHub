                           <p>STEM program focuses on education in four specific disciplines: Science, Technology, 
                           Engineering, and Mathematics. These programs aim to integrate these subjects in a cohesive 
                           learning model based on real-world applications. The goal is to foster critical thinking, 
                           problem-solving, and innovation skills by encouraging students to apply their knowledge in 
                           practical, hands-on projects. STEM education is designed to prepare students for careers in 
                           fields that require strong analytical and technical skills, and it often emphasizes collaboration, 
                           experimentation, and creativity.</p>
